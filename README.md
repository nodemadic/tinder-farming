Outline:

1. Use Selenium to navigate to the Tinder web app and log in to your account.

2. Locate the image of the potential match on the Tinder web app using CSS selectors or XPath expressions.

3. Use an HTTP client library such as Requests or Axios to send a POST request to the API with the image data as the request payload.

4. Parse the response from the API to determine whether to swipe left or right. Set a threshold value that determines what is considered a "good" or "bad" match based on the API's output.

5. Use the automation tool to swipe left or right based on the result of the previous step. You can simulate a swipe action by clicking on the corresponding button on the Tinder web app using CSS selectors or XPath expressions.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each potential match on the Tinder web app until you have swiped left or right on all of them.

7. Build logic to remove pop-ups from Tinder web app as needed to allow unobstructed view of the image
